*RuneInfo is a simple, but effective discord bot that allows you to view in game information through discord. Such as, item prices, player stats or boss kill count.*

## Getting Started

### Executing program

* Currently there two commands available on RuneInfo
* Using a command just requires the user to use `/` or look at the `Slash Commands` available in the discord chat.
